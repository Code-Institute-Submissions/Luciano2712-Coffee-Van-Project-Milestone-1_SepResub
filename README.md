### Features Left to Implement

- Booking system would be a good feature to be added.
- Overall, I would revise the spacing and padding of the site's text. The text could be better centered and spread on larger screens to improve readability for the user.

## Structure

- The main structure of this website involves 2 pages, the Home page(which is divided in 4 sections, What We Do, Curiosities, Menu, Contact Us) and the Events Gallery page.

- The pages will all include the same heading and footer.

- The header of each page is the same with nav bars.

- The footer of each page is the same with links to social medias.

## Target Audience

Men and women who are looking to take their event/ special ocasion to another level of experience using our Coffee Van. They will be aged between 30-50, earning well and looking for something special.

## Strategy

My goal of this site is to create a simple, visually appealing website to help customers personalize their events with a nice vintage touch and with excellet services.

## Testing
