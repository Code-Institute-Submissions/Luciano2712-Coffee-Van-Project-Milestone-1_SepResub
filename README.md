## Strategy

My goal of this site is to create a simple, visually appealing website to help customers personalize their events with a nice vintage touch and with excellet services.

## Structure

The main structure of this website involves 2 pages, the Home page(which is divided in 4 sections, What We Do, Curiosities, Menu, Contact Us) and the Events Gallery page.

The pages will all include the same heading and footer.

The header of each page is the same with nav bars.

The footer of each page is the same with links to social medias.

### Features Left To Implement

- Overall, I would recommend revising the spacing and padding of the site's text. The text could be better centered and spread on larger screens to improve readability for the user.
- Responsivenes of the header and footer also needs adjustments.
